# HappyGhastWar
HappyGhastWar is a minigame plugin inspired by the Happy Ghast update in version 1.21.6. Similar to bedwars, your goal is to protect your team's Happy Ghast while eliminating other teams. Gather resources by mining ores across the map and spend them at the central shop to gear up. With an added shrinking zone mechanic, the battlefield will gradually close in—so make sure to push toward the center and fight for victory! For detailed gameplay information, please refer to [Mythend's video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FThjzrEC8/?share_source=copy_web&v) (The video is in Chinese.).
